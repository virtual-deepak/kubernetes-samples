Learning journey and experimenting with various aspects of Kubernetes. Contains "less scary" sample applications to drive home the conceptual understanding in the simplest possible way I could. 

 

#### Largely motivated from - 
1.   [CKAD learning path from Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad) by courses from The Docker Captains - [Dan Wahlin](https://github.com/danwahlin) and [Nigel Poulton](https://github.com/nigelpoulton)  

Some learnings and troubleshooting of issues while following these can be found [here](https://virtualdeepak.com)
